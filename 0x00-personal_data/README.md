Personally identifiable information (PII) and personal data are two classifications of data that often confuse organizations that collect, store and analyze such data. Both terms cover common ground, classifying information that could reveal an individual’s identity directly or indirectly. 

PII is used in the US, but no specific legal document defines it. The legal system in the United States is a blend of numerous federal and state laws and sector-specific regulations, all of which describe and classify different pieces of information under the PII umbrella. 

On the other hand, personal data has one legal definition established by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is accepted as law across the European Union (EU).

But why is all that so important? As a website admin, app creator or product owner, you need to be aware that visitors and users could share sensitive information with you. These traces might enable you to identify individuals, so you must handle such data carefully. From a legal standpoint, it could be a matter of breaches and violations with serious consequences. Grasping the bigger picture is crucial for your organization’s security and legal compliance.
